** This is a simple hack of the original Gesturefy extension which removes the requirement for several of the WebExtension API permissions ("storage", "notifications", "sessions", "browserSettings").**

It was done mostly as an experiment to see how much gesturing functionality would remain with as few permissions as possible. 

Known broken stuff: 
- the options page no longer works. Only some basic default gestures will work (scroll to top/bottom, next/prev page, next/prev tab, new tab, reload tab). 
- rocker & wheel gestures were intentionally removed
- guestures don't work on the installation splash page
- context menus are gone

**Why does Gesturefy require permission X?**

 - Access your data for all websites: *This is a key permission, because the complete gesture functionality is injected in every web page you visit (which means a part of the code is running in each tab). This is necessary, because with the new API there is no other way to track your mouse movement or draw anything on the screen. It's also needed to perform page specific commands like scroll down or up.*
 - Read and modify browser settings:  *This is required to change the context menu behaviour for MacOS and Linux user to support the usage of the right mouse button.*
 - Display notifications to you: *This is used to show a notification on update or certain error messages.*
 - Access recently closed tabs: *This is required for the command which allows to restore the last closed tab.*
